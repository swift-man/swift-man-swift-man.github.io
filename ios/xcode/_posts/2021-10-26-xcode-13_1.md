# Xcode 13.1 Release Notes
Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.

## Overview
Xcode 13.1 includes SDKs for iOS 15, iPadOS 15, tvOS 15, watchOS 8, and macOS Monterey 12. The Xcode 13.1 release supports on-device debugging for iOS 9 and later, tvOS 9 and later, and watchOS 2 and later. Xcode 13.1 requires a Mac running macOS 11.3 or later.

## Debugging
### Known Issues
* Console, Xcode, lldb, and debugging tools can’t symbolicate crash logs that macOS transfers from connected devices running iOS 15, watchOS 8, or tvOS 15. (78124467, 83760462, 84048036, 84048399) (FB9669482)

  Workaround: Use Xcode’s Devices & Simulators window > View Device Logs to import log files from connected devices, and transform them into a human-readable form. You can also access crash logs directly on iOS devices using the Settings app under Privacy > Analytics > Analytics Data and use AirDrop to transfer them to a Mac without any loss of information. Open the resulting log files using Console, or by dragging and dropping them onto Xcode in the Dock.

## Interface Builder
### Resolved Issues
* Fixed rendering issues that affected [<i class="fas fa-link"></i> UITableView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitableview){:target="_blank"} for some iOS storyboards. (82731572, 83465487)

* Fixed an issue where iPhone 13 mini wouldn’t rotate to landscape orientation. (83465491)

## Source Control
### Known Issues
* Adding commits to a pull request in Xcode may not update the Changes navigator until you re-launch Xcode. (70398244)

  Workaround: Re-launch Xcode.

* The Recent Branches section may continue to display an Upstream Arrow on a branch after you push changes on that branch. (80597226)

  Workaround: Restart Xcode to update the status.

* Xcode may not correctly format code in pull request comments. (82143328)

* Xcode may forget or reject credentials for GitLab Self-Hosted accounts. (82501314)

* Repositories Navigator may sometimes display the current branch indicator on multiple branches. (82629835)

  Workaround: Re-launch Xcode or wait for the status of these files to update.

* In Flat view mode, the Commit sheet may sometimes present without selecting a file. (83417116)

## Swift
### Resolved Issues
* Fixed an issue where availability checks in iPhone and iPad apps running on a Mac with Apple silicon always returned true, which caused iOS apps running in macOS Big Sur to see iOS 15 APIs as available and crash when trying to use those APIs. These availability checks now return the correct result for apps compiled with Xcode 13.1. (83378814)

## SwiftUI
### Known Issues
* In Previews and in simulated iOS 15 devices, [<i class="fas fa-link"></i> Button](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Button){:target="_blank"} elements support the iPad cursor hover states by default, but in iOS 15.1 [<i class="fas fa-link"></i> BorderedButtonStyle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/BorderedButtonStyle){:target="_blank"} no longer has a default hover effect. Use the [<i class="fas fa-link"></i> HoverEffect](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/HoverEffect){:target="_blank"} modifier on the Button to add a default hover effect when running in iOS 15.1.
